What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","   *   INTERPRETED ARE EXECUTE LINE BY LINE\n","   *   COMPLIED ARE EXECUTE DIRECTLY\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","  *  Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully manage errors that may occur during the execution of your program, instead of letting the program crash unexpectedly.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","   *  Always execute, even if you enter exception block or not, finally will be executed always.similary to running other line of code\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","   *  It recorder the state and flow of your program code/software.\n","   *  It is usefull for understanding,monitering and debugging of your code\n","\n","\n","5.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","   *  The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method, which is called when an object is about to be destroyed—typically when its reference count drops to zero . It allows you to define clean-up behavior for your object, such as closing files, releasing resources, or logging final messages.\n","\n","6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","   *  In Python, import and from ... import are both used to bring external modules, packages, or specific objects into your code, but they differ in how they do it and what gets imported into your namespace.\n","\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","   * Always catch specific error.\n","\n","   * specificity in exception handling.\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","   * The with statement in Python is used to simplify resource management, especially when working with files, network connections, or any resource that needs to be properly opened and then closed—even if an error occurs during usage.\n","\n","9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","   *  multithreading, process run concureently on multiple threads in a\n","     processor  is called as miltithreading\n","\n","   *  multiprocessing, runs paralley on multiple processor that called as   multiprocessing.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","   * Using logging in a program provides several important advantages over using simple print statements, especially as your application grows in size or complexity.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","   * Memory management in Python refers to how the language allocates, tracks, and reclaims memory used by objects during a program's execution. It ensures efficient use of memory and helps prevent issues like memory leaks or crashes.\n","\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","   * Exception handling in Python is used to catch and respond to errors gracefully, preventing program crashes and enabling recovery or informative messages.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","   * Memory management is crucial in Python because it directly affects your programs performance, stability, and scalability.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","   \n","   * The try and except blocks are core tools in Python's exception handling system. They allow your program to catch and respond to runtime errors gracefully—without crashing.\n","\n","15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","   * Pythons garbage collection system is responsible for automatically freeing memory by removing objects that are no longer needed. This helps prevent memory leaks and makes memory management easier for developers.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","   \n","   * The else block in Python exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","   \n","   * Pythons built-in logging module defines five standard logging levels, which represent the severity of messages you want to track. Each level has a corresponding numeric value.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork and multiprocessing in Python?\n","  \n","   * Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module can be used to create new processes in Python, but they differ significantly in how they work, their portability, safety, and ease of use.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","   * Closing a file in Python is essential for ensuring proper resource management, data integrity, and system performance. When you open a file (e.g., with open()), the operating system allocates resources for it — and you must release them by closing the file.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","   \n","   * file.read(),Reads the entire file (or a specified number of characters) into a single string.\n","\n","   *file.readline(), Reads one line at a time from the file.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","   * The logging module in Python is a standard library tool used to record messages from a program — such as errors, warnings, or general status updates — in a systematic, configurable, and scalable way.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","   \n","   * The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, especially for performing file and directory operations. It allows you to manipulate files, folders, and paths in a way that's portable across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","   * Although Python handles much of the memory management automatically through reference counting and garbage collection, there are still several challenges that developers may face.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","   * In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","   * Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows your program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, leading to better responsiveness, efficiency, and resource utilization—especially in I/O-bound scenarios."],"metadata":{"id":"SSh0FrxCsxce"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1 How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it.\n","\n","with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n","    file.write(\"Hello, this is a string\")"],"metadata":{"id":"N9F8NHhrhLe2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750493460484,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Sahil Dhawane","userId":"01439639010080164396"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2 Write a Python program to read the contents of a file and print each line?\n","\n","with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n","\n","    for line in file:\n","        print(line, end=\"\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SepGNBcPhskk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750493447040,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":83,"user":{"displayName":"Sahil Dhawane","userId":"01439639010080164396"}},"outputId":"6c5c1c5a-27cb-4c4b-8872-9b911d6ea586"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, this is a string"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#3 How would you handle a case where the file doesn't exist while trying to open it for reading?\n","\n","  filename = \"nonexistent.txt\"\n","\n","try:\n","    with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n","        for line in file:\n","            print(line, end=\"\")\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(f\"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4H44WabCirOe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4 Write a Python script that reads from one file and writes its content to another fileF\n","\n","source_file = \"input.txt\"\n","destination_file = \"output.txt\"\n","\n","try:\n","\n","    with open(source_file, \"r\") as src:\n","\n","        with open(destination_file, \"w\") as dest:\n","\n","            for line in src:\n","                dest.write(line)\n","    print(f\"Contents copied from '{source_file}' to '{destination_file}'.\")\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(f\"Error: The file '{source_file}' does not exist.\")\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mQilkx_0i9Dc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#5 How would you catch and handle division by zero error in Python?\n","\n","  try:\n","    numerator = 10\n","    denominator = 0\n","    result = numerator / denominator\n","    print(\"Result:\", result)\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ocr4Nq9TjP5X"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#6 Write a Python program that logs an error message to a log file when a division by zero exception occurs\n","\n","  import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(\n","    filename='error_log.txt',\n","    level=logging.ERROR,\n","    format='%(asctime)s -
